This repository serves as a portfolio of frontend challenges that I've completed during various interview processes, or just built by myself to study. These challenges are designed to assess my skills in frontend technologies, mainly React and Angular.

Each project in this repository is a submodule that represents a different challenge. You can navigate to each submodule to see the code for that project.

## Projects

Each project has its own README file with instructions on how to install and run the project, as well as a link to the deployed project (if available).

## Installation

To clone and run the projects, you'll need Git installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/narcizo/frontend-challenges.git
# Go into the repository
cd frontend-challenges/<project-name>
# Install dependencies and run the app
npm install
npm start
```
